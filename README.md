Blender FBX Importer is a Unity Editor extension that allows you to import FBX models directly into Blender from Unity by running Blender executable with Python expression arguments.

Simply right click an FBX model file in your Unity Editor's Project window and click `Import FBX to Blender` to open the prompt

If you only need the Python code for importing the model(s) yourself through Blender's console, you also have the option to only copy the code.

# Compatibility Notice

This extension has so far only been tested in **Unity 2019.4.31f1** and **Blender 2.9+**. If you have issues using it in other versions, please let me know so I can look into adding compatibility for them.
