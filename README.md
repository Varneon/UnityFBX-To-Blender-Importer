Blender FBX Importer is an editor window that allows you to import FBX models directly into Blender from Unity by running Blender executable with Python expression arguments.

Simply right click an FBX model file in your Unity Editor's Project window and click `Import FBX to Blender` to open the prompt

If you only need the Python code for importing the model(s) yourself through Blender's console, you also have the option to only copy the code.
